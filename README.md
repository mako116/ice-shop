#### Project Scope:  

This was a 2 day REACT Frontend Engineer challenge Assessment Application for ICE Solar Commercial Power. 

This project is integrated with the following Functionalities:
- Authentication (Login)
- Add & Update User
- User show be able to view categories
- User should be able to view products by categories
- User should be able to add product to cart
- User should be able to view products in cart

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-6.0` and `redux`.  


At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.0, Redux, axios, redux-persist, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, CSS and SCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
